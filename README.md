### Hi there 👋

<!--
**jeffreydunaway/jeffreydunaway** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently a Food Bank Coordinator with a local Food Bank in Seattle, WA. I'm currently working on an Overlay Project using JavaScript for the local Food Bank. My goal for this project will increase the data visual for our local community and identfiy where, when, and who the customers are. Currently using Google Maps and figuring out a way to use JavaScript for the area we "canvass" every week. Additionally, we are increasing our database through passing out flyers to every residential neighborhood within the Seattle neighborhood. Some commercial sites are included in the Data Visual/ Overlay Project in the Google Maps. Each data point will represent the stage in the process of the canvassing. For example, a Green Icon = a sustained customer; Yellow= someone who has made contact with the local Food Bank and maybe wants to donate/ visit/ volunteer; Red= someone/ some place we literally made contact with. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript: React.js, Vue.js, and Node.js. HTML5, CSS3
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any mapping project, from Microsoft Maps to Google Maps to the Apple Maps. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with contributing/ learning/ and I need a patient mentor. 
- 💬 Ask me about questions in life! I have some life experience and I'm not bald for no reason. :)
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter; LinkedIn (still a work in progress); and through GitHub! 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/ Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I slipped and almost fell into a Class 6 Rapid, but somehow I survived!
