<b> ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
</b>



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a Food Bank Coordinator with a local Food Bank in Seattle, WA. I'm currently working on an Overlay Project using JavaScript for the local Food Bank. My goal for this project will increase the data visual for our local community and identfiy where, when, and who the customers are. Currently using Google Maps and figuring out a way to use JavaScript for the area we "canvass" every week. Additionally, we are increasing our database through passing out flyers to every residential neighborhood within the Seattle neighborhood. Some commercial sites are included in the Data Visual/ Overlay Project in the Google Maps. Each data point will represent the stage in the process of the canvassing. For example, a Green Icon = a sustained customer; Yellow= someone who has made contact with the local Food Bank and maybe wants to donate/ visit/ volunteer; Red= someone/ some place we literally made contact with.
